## Cybercrime Taxonomy -NCRP Assistant Overview

The **NCRP Assistant** is an innovative complaint management system designed to streamline the process of submitting and managing complaints related to cybercrime. By leveraging **AI-driven suggestions** and the powerful capabilities of **Gemini**, this application enhances user experience through intelligent categorization and personalized recommendations.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Anaconda** (for environment management)
- **Python 3.9.4**
- **Google Cloud Service Account Key** (if applicable)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a New Environment
To start, create a virtual environment with the required version of Python:

```bash
conda create -n venv python==3.9.4
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate your environment by running:

```bash
conda activate venv
```

### 3. Install Requirements
Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add Your Gemini Google API Key
Open the `env.txt` file in your project directory and add your Gemini Google API key:

```plaintext
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### 5. Set Up Google Cloud Authentication (If Applicable)
If using Gemini's API with Google Cloud services, follow these steps:

- **Create a Service Account Key:**
  1. Go to the Google Cloud Console.
  2. Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts.
  3. Select your project and click on "Create Service Account."
  4. Assign the necessary permissions and click "Done."
  5. Download the JSON key file for your service account.

- **Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS Environment Variable:**
  - On Linux/macOS:
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account-file.json"
    ```
  - On Windows:
    ```cmd
    set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\path\to\service-account-file.json
    ```

**Troubleshooting:** If you encounter issues like "Compute Engine Metadata server unavailable" or "Gemini Model Initialization Failed," verify that the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path is correct and that the environment variable is properly set.

### üéâ Run the Streamlit Application
To run the application, execute:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

If you face authentication issues, revisit Step 5 to ensure correct setup of the service account key.
